# 🕺 AI Dance Mirror

A fun experiment combining **computer vision** and **machine learning** — I built a real-time motion tracking system that mirrors my dance moves using a stick figure or avatar!

## 🎯 Overview

This project uses **Python**, **MediaPipe**, and **OpenCV** to detect human pose landmarks from webcam input and display them on a second “virtual mirror” window.

It’s a small but exciting step toward understanding how motion capture, fitness tracking, and interactive animation systems work under the hood.
